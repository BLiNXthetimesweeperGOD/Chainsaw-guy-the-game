# Chainsaw guy Chops Some Trees
Chainsaw guy is mad that a tree dropped an acorn on his head so he must chop down all of the trees in the universe in an act of revenge

In this game, you go through 5 insanely detailed levels where you can do the following actions:

Each level has an incredibly detailed opening and ending cutscene with plenty of words to read and emotions to be had.
